The third DARUMA workshop was held in Munich between **March 19** and **March 20, 2024**. 

On the first day, we hosted a public workshop centered on the theme of "Transportation Resilience & Opportunistic Data." The agenda for the workshop can be accessed [here](/files/munich_agenda_full.pdf). Alongside the project participants from Kyoto University (Japan), TU Munich (Germany), UC Madrid (Spain), and Budapest ME (Hungary), we were delighted to welcome representatives from the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (MVV), Munich Transport Company (MVG), as well as other research groups with interests aligned with the workshop's focus. Additionally, we had the privilege of inviting Vineet Chaturvedi from TUM to present insights and accomplishments from another CONCERT-Japan project, 3VRUT (Assessment of Transformations in Vitality, Vulnerability, and Versatility of Rural Towns).

On the second day, the DARUMA project partners from Kyoto University (Japan), TU Munich (Germany), Budapest ME (Hungary), UC Madrid (Spain), and Hitachi (Japan) convened for an internal project meeting. Each group provided updates on their respective contributions to the project. Over the course of the meeting, we summarized the outcomes achieved by the DARUMA project in the previous three years and engaged in discussions about potential future collaborations.

We extend our gratitude to the Technical University of Munich for hosting and organizing this workshop, and we express our appreciation to all project partners from Munich, Madrid, and Budapest for their active participation and valuable insights shared during the discussions. Furthermore, we would like to thank our esteemed guests from MVV, MVG, LHM Mobilit√§tsreferat, Posmo/Datamap, Shiv Nadar University, and Hasselt University for their presence and contributions, which enriched the workshop with their diverse experiences and expertise in relevant areas.
