This paper proposes a conceptual evaluation framework for transport-related pandemic containment policies from the perspective of urban resilience. Given the findings from the literature and the characteristics of pandemics, the framework is composed of four layers, i.e., (transport-related) Governance-Transport (operations)-Mobility-Resilience (GTMR), that are used to specify the policy establishment, transportation system reactions, individual mobility patterns, and resilience performance evaluation, respectively. It provides a way of: (1) understanding the effects of transport-related policies on urban resilience during pandemics; (2) fusing different sources of data to develop an urban resilience estimation model. In addition, the relations between prevalent transport-related containment policies and the classic “4R” resilience properties (i.e., robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity) are also analysed. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed GTMR framework, we present an application example to qualitatively evaluate the impacts of these policies on urban resilience. Practical evidence from New York City is also discussed.
