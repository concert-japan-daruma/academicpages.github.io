Road traffic congestion has become an everyday phenomenon in today's cities all around the world. The reason is
clear: at peak hours, the road network operates at full capacity. In this way, growing traffic demand cannot be
satisfied, not even with traffic-responsive signal plans. The external impacts of traffic congestion come with a
serious socio-economic cost: air pollution, increased travel times and fuel consumption, stress, as well as higher
risk of accidents. To tackle these problems, a number of European cities have implemented reduced speed limit
measures. Similarly, a general urban speed limit measure is in preparatory phase in Budapest, Hungary. In this
context, a complex preliminary impact assessment is needed using a simulated environment. Two typical network
parts of Budapest were analyzed with microscopic traffic simulations. The results revealed that speed limits can
affect traffic differently in diverse network types indicating that thorough examination and preparation works are
needed prior to the introduction of speed limit reduction.
