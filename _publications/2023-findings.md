We explore how different socioeconomic groups adapt to the snowstorm Filomena that occurred in Madrid in 2021. A reverse interpretation of the resilience triangle is proposed, where smaller triangle areas indicate less resilient populations continuing to travel despite disruptions, while larger demand losses indicate greater adaptability. Using Google Popular Times data, the study measures activity levels in neighborhoods, focusing on essential and non-essential trips. Vulnerable groups with lower incomes show limited adaptability, resulting in a smaller reduction in commercial activities compared to affluent neighborhoods. The study emphasizes the significance of considering demand adaptability and socioeconomic factors in assessing resilience.
